## 🎯 About the Project

This project is an implementation of the Snap card game built in Java as part of my journey to strengthen software engineering fundamentals. The game demonstrates core OOP concepts including classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and collection handling through an interactive console-based interface.

### Key Concepts Demonstrated

- **Object-Oriented Programming**

## Features

- [ ] Full 52-card deck implementation with Unicode suit symbols (♥ ♣ ♦ ♠)

## Technologies Used

- **Java** - Core programming language


## Getting Started
